    I just recently upgraded to macOS Catalina, and needed to flash a microSD
    card for my Raspberry Pi. However, balenaEtcher was throwing an error when
    trying to flash the image.
</p>
<p>
    After a little while, I realized that Catalina included some extra privacy
    protections. I went into System Preferences and turned on “Full Disk Access”
    for balenaEtcher. But lo and behold, the error still persisted.

<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>
    After doing a bit of research, I found that balenaEtcher, and Etcher (the
    former name of balenaEtcher), had a command-line utility to launch the app.
</p>
<p>
    <code>sudo /Applications/balenaEtcher.app/Contents/MacOS/balenaEtcher</code>
</p>
<p>
    The command booted up a graphical interface of balenaEtcher, the difference
    that, because of the “sudo” in the command, it ran under the root user. This
    bypassed the security/privacy restrictions placed (wisely) by Apple on
    Catalina.
