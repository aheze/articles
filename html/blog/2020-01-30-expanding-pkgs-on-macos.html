    Let's say you're on a computer where you don’t have administrative access,
    but you really need to use this one piece of software. In my case, this was
    Apple’s SF Symbols app. There’s a pretty simple way to extract the payload
    from the package (.PKG).
</p>
<p>
    To get started, you first need two things. A macOS-equipped computer and a
    DMG with a PKG inside, or just a PKG. This tutorial will detail both.
</p>
<h2>Extracting the Package Contents</h2>
<p><strong>If your PKG is inside of a DMG, start here.</strong></p>
<p>
    To extract the payload from a PKG inside of a DMG, we need to mount the DMG.
    There are two ways to do this. You can either use the Finder (double-click
    the DMG to mount it) or use the terminal with the following command:
</p>
<pre><code>
hdiutil attach &lt;PATH_TO_YOUR_DMG&gt;
(EXAMPLE) hdiutil attach ~/Downloads/SF-Symbols.dmg
    </code></pre>
<p><strong>PKG Extraction</strong></p>
<p>
    Now is where we have to use the terminal. In your terminal, navigate to the
    folder just above where you want your PKG to be extracted. An example
    command is as follows: <code>cd ~/Documents/</code>
</p>
<p>You can then proceed to extract the PKG with:</p>
<pre><code>
pkgutil --expand-full &lt;PATH_TO_PKG&gt; &lt;FOLDER_TO_EXTRACT_TO&gt;/
(PKG inside of DMG) pkgutil --expand-full /Volumes/&lt;VOLUME_NAME&gt;/&lt;PACKAGE&gt;.pkg &lt;FOLDER_TO_EXTRACT_TO&gt;/
(EXAMPLE) pkgutil --expand-full /Volumes/SFSymbols/SF\ Symbols.pkg extracted_package/
    </code></pre>
<p>
    The snippet below is what my terminal looked like after extracting the
    package to the “extracted_package” folder.
</p>
<pre><code>
Daedalus:~/Documents/extracted_package hkamran$ ls
Distribution  Resources     SFSymbols.pkg
    </code></pre>
<p>To see what is inside of the payload, type:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
cd &lt;PACKAGE_NAME&gt;.pkg/Payload/; open $(pwd)
(EXAMPLE) cd SFSymbols.pkg/Payload/; open $(pwd)
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    <em>
        The <strong>open $(pwd)</strong> command opens the current directory
        with the Finder.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The folder hierarchy of the Payload folder is very simple. The directories
    are the places to put the files. For example, the directory
    <em>Applications</em> has “SF Symbols.app”, because that needs to be put in
    the Applications folder on your computer.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have extracted the Payload, you can eject the volume (if you are
    using a DMG) or delete the PKG, as you no longer need it.
